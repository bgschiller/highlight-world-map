Highlight-World-Map
-------------------

This is a simple tool for making maps highlighting certain countries. It's nothing  fancy, but (in my opinion) it does one job well. Right now, it uses the [Robinson projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection), although that may be configurable in the future.

The use case I imagined for this is making a map for a presentation. For example, "Our company is present in all these countries." To save a map, you would make the map as large as needed (increase the text size, use a high-resolution monitor, etc) and take a screenshot. If you have a suggestion for a better way to save the map, please let me know with an issue or pull request.

The default color for highlighted countries is [Nielsen](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html) blue (my employer).

I'm pretty new to javascript, d3, and web programming in general. If you notice something that could be improved, please let me know. This is primarily a learning experience for me.
